# coreboot devicetree.cb language package

Adds syntax highlighting to coreboot devicetree.cb files in Atom.

These keywords were pulled from the sconfig.l file in coreboot's
util/sconfig/sconfig.l file.

To add the grammar manually under linux, place the language-devicetree
directory or a symbolic link to it into the ~/.atom/packages directory.
In windows, it goes into the users/<username>/.atom/packages directory.
